# Abstract {.unnumbered}

In hybrid quantum circuits, different mesoscopic systems can be combined to 
harness advantages and properties of each
constituent, facilitating the unraveling of new phenomena which surmount the
usual paradigm of light-matter interaction.
Specifically, they can exhibit complex behavior as they operate far from
equilibrium, and strong nonlinear interactions can emerge. Furthermore, their
open dynamics due to the unavoidable coupling to the environment can be tailored
using engineered reservoirs. 
In this Thesis, I have addressed these fundamental aspects in three specific 
systems formed by mesoscopic conductors and quantum dots coupled to localized resonators.

First, I have considered a solid-state implementation of a single-atom laser in a
quantum-dot spin valve, where electronic spin is coupled to a harmonic oscillator. A spin-polarized current injected in the dot induces lasing, whereby energy is
pumped with high efficiency into the resonator. This pumping mechanism rapidly leads to a 
breakdown of the widely employed rotating-wave approximation (RWA) without
any requirement of ultrastrong light-matter coupling. Such
RWA breakdown is associated with multistability of the resonator, characterized by
multiple peaks in its Fock distribution and detectable with simple current
measurements displaying telegraph dynamics.

In a second work, I have examined a Cooper-pair splitter consisting of two
quantum dots, each coupled capacitively to a local resonator and a common
superconductor. I derived an effective Hamiltonian validated by
numerical simulations, and I demonstrated that the process of cross-Andreev reflection can be
used to pump nonlocally single photons
between the two resonators or to simultaneously cool them into their ground state.
The system has possible applications such as coherent heat-control,
cooling with single-photon precision, and
microwave photon buses.

The third system that I studied consists of a Josephson junction in series with an
electromagnetic resonator. When a voltage is applied to the junction, such that
each Cooper pair can provide half the energy to generate a
cavity photon, charge transport and photon emission can be dominated by effective inelastic tunneling of two
Cooper pairs. The system displays a crossover from incoherent to coherent 
double Cooper-pair tunneling and can be further used as a single-photon source due to
a form of photon-blockade effect.

<!-- Finally, within an experimental collaboration, I have investigated a circuit formed by a
fluxonium qubit coupled to a chain of LC-resonators, which serves as a
quantum simulator for a generalized spin-boson model. I have derived the
effective Hamiltonian for
the system and, using realistic experimental parameters, I simulated numerically
its relaxation dynamics,
characterized by collapse and revival of qubit oscillation due to its coherent
interaction with a finite-size bath of resonators. -->
