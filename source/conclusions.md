# Conclusions and outlook {#sec:conclusions}

In this work, I have presented different hybrid quantum circuits composed of quantum dots
or Josephson junctions coupled to electromagnetic or mechanical cavities.
These ensembles offer an extremely rich and diverse physics, which goes
beyond the standard light-matter interaction originally studied in cavity QED,
using real atoms and optical or microwave cavities. Indeed, quantum dots and
superconducting qubits are exceptionally versatile and tunable, allowing to
carefully design a solid-state chip where interactions and energy-exchange
mechanisms can be controlled.

The first system I considered is a realization of a single-atom laser
which takes advantage of a spin-polarized current to pump energy with high
efficiency into a
resonator, such that the standard rotating-wave
approximation (RWA) for the model Hamiltonian no longer holds even at weak couplings. After
numerical solution of the full master equation, I have interpreted the unconventional
results for the state of the resonator within a semiclassical picture, showing that
the RWA breakdown, induced by a strongly nonlinear interaction between electron
spin and cavity, leads to a multistable lasing regime where multiple stable
amplitudes of oscillation can coexist. I have further shown that these remarkable
features can be detected through simple monitoring of the electric current in
real time, without resorting to more complicated techniques involving optical
detection or tomography of the cavity state. The described model carries
important theoretical results, as it provides a way to investigate coherent dynamics beyond
the RWA outside the ultrastrong coupling regime. From a more practical point of view, our
work raises interesting questions about the extent
to which a multistable laser can be controlled
and exploited, e.g., in nonlinear amplifiers or force-sensing
devices.

Secondly, I discussed a device consisting of a quantum-dot-based Cooper-pair
splitter (CPS) with local capacitive coupling to two harmonic cavities. Here, I have
shown that the
Cooper-pair breaking from a central superconductor induces nonlocal correlations
in the two resonators. More specifically, by tuning the gate voltages
controlling the electrostatic energy of the dots, photons can be transferred efficiently from one
cavity to the other, establishing a steady nonequilibrium heat flow. Such energy
flow can further be channeled to cool down one or both cavities into their
ground state, enabling few-photon (or few-phonon) coherent manipulation. The
proposed setup is therefore a versatile tool to fully
inspect heat exchange mechanisms in hybrid circuits, leading to nanoscale heat
pumps and cooling devices.

Finally, in a third work, I have investigated the double-Cooper pair tunneling mechanism in a Josephson
junction coupled to a microwave LC-resonator. By deriving
an effective Hamiltonian description for the circuit when the Josephson frequency is
half of the resonator frequency, it is possible to distinguish two regimes
where the transport across the junction and the photon emission from the cavity
are determined by tunneling of two Cooper pairs: an incoherent regime, when
double-Cooper pair transport first begins to dominate, and a coherent regime
emerging at larger Josephson frequencies. Furthermore, by examining the second-order
correlation functions for the emitted photons, it is possible to show that the
system displays an unusual form of photon blockade and therefore can be used as
a single-photon source. The system considered can be used as a testbed to
explore how microwave resonators can control electron transport and has
potential implications in the study of overbias photon emission in
superconducting scanning tunneling microscopy.

<!-- Finally, I have studied numerically the relaxation dynamics of a hybrid circuit
formed by a fluxonium superconducting qubit strongly coupled to a chain of
LC-resonators. The system, envisaged within an experimental collaboration, can
be
used as a quantum simulator for the spin-boson model, which is the prototypical approach
to the study of the dissipation in a two-level system. After a derivation of the
effective Hamiltonian for the designed circuit, I have studied its dynamics
through numerical simulations with real experimental parameters for the
fabricated components. The results show how relaxation takes the form of
collapse and revival of qubit oscillations, due to the coherent coupling to a small number of environmental resonators. As a consequence, this setup can be used
for an in-depth analysis of the onset of dissipation in solid-state circuits, as
well as a platform of reservoir-engineering in quantum information processing
and quantum simulation. -->

The above discussion demonstrates how hybrid systems are a powerful tool to
explore novel regimes of interactions, or to gain deeper knowledge on the
mechanisms underlying the standard QED architectures. Besides, they offer a
practical advantage as they can be integrated into several architectures such as
cooling devices, detectors, sensors and quantum computers. The rich physics of
the systems presented requires a more profound analysis: Future research directions might focus on a closer investigation of the single-atom
lasing regime attainable using quantum dots. Specifically, the increasing
experimental effort
towards the realization of a controllable strong spin-photon and spin-vibration
coupling can be strengthened and stimulated by our work of Ref.
\onlinecite{Mantovani2019}. Alternative implementations can
be constructed using multiple quantum dots, or exploiting a thermal gradient
between two normal-metal electrodes comprising a double quantum dot. The latter
represents a mesoscopic single-emitter quantum heat engine, which can attract
the interest of the
quantum thermodynamics community. From a theoretical point of
view, an accurate description of the phase diffusion dynamics for this type of
single-atom laser can be significant.
The CPS device presented in Ref. \onlinecite{Mantovani2019a} might be further
investigated including time-dependent protocols controlling the gate voltages
applied to the dots, which can in turn fine-tune the coherent photon transfer between the
cavities to generate entanglement and perform quantum state engineering.
Moreover, coupling CPSs to microwave cavities is essential to demonstrate
the coherence of Cooper-pair injection, due to coherent cross-Andreev
reflection, through microwave spectroscopy [@Cottet2014;@Bruhat2018].
