# Preface {.unnumbered}

The work presented in this Dissertation has been carried out during my PhD
studies under the supervision of Dr. Gianluca Rastelli and Prof. Dr. Wolfgang
Belzig
between May 2017 and March 2020 in the Quantum Transport Group of the
Department of Physics, Universität of Konstanz.
The results presented in Chapters -@sec:qdlaser,[^1] -@sec:cps[^2] and -@sec:jjcavity[^3] are published as articles
in peer-reviewed
international journals.
Except where the references are made, this Thesis is entirely the
outcome of multiple scientific collaborations established by Dr. Rastelli and Prof.
Belzig and thereby contains a lot of valuable inputs from their side.
The numerical code implemented to obtain the results of this Dissertation
has been developed by me.
Dr. Robert Hussein from the University of Konstanz is
greatly acknowledged for the fruitful discussions and the technical support received during
the path that led to the work presented in Ch. -@sec:cps.
I would like to appreciate here the hospitality received from
Prof. Dr. Andrew Armour at the University of Nottingham, during my visits in
February 2017 and February 2019, that led to the development of the results
presented in Chs. @sec:qdlaser and @sec:jjcavity.
<!-- Furthermore, I acknowledge the hospitality received in the Équipe Cohérence
Quantique at Institut Néel in Grenoble during my
visit in September 2017 within a collaboration with the experimental group of
Prof. Dr. Wiebke Hasch-Guichard. The results of this collaboration are presented
in Ch. -@sec:spinboson. -->
