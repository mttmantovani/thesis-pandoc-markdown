# Theory of the quantum master equation {#theory}

## Introduction
Any realistic investigation of a quantum system requires taking into account its
coupling to the rest of the world. Therefore, the derivation of a suitable
equation describing the dynamics of the density matrix of a system is
the primary ingredient both in the theoretical analysis and in the validation of
experimental data. In this Chapter, we will focus on a class of master
equations that can describe faithfully the solid-state devices presented in the
following Chapters of the Thesis. Typically, these systems follow a
Markovian dynamics, since they are weakly coupled to an environment with many
degrees of freedom, and system-environment correlations are lost quickly when
compared to the timescale on which the state of the system varies appreciably.

The most general form of a Markovian master equation can be rigorously
formulated in terms of the generator of a quantum dynamical semigroup, giving rise to the standard
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKLS or, more commonly, Lindblad)
