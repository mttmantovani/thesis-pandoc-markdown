## Introduction 

One of the most remarkable features of hybrid quantum-dot-based systems is the
possibility of engineering correlations between distant subsystems and giving
rise to nonlocal effects, which are inherently quantum mechanical. A relevant
example is represented by the Cooper pairs in a superconductor, which are a
natural source of entangled electrons. Cooper pairs can be split using a
Cooper-pair splitter (CPS), a device widely studied both theoretically
