## Coupling light and matter: Cavity quantum electrodynamics
One of the most succesful and ever-developing applications of the quantum theory
is the investigation of the interaction between *light* and *matter*.
Historically, the first experiments involved real atoms
interacting with the quantized electromagnetic field of optical and microwave
cavities, within the framework commonly
referred to as cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED)
[@Raimond2001;@Walther2006;@Haroche2006].

## Structure of this Thesis and goals

The main goal of this Thesis is to discuss and investigate a
family of hybrid setups where quantum dots (or Josephson junctions) are coupled to bosonic cavities (nanomechanical
resonators or superconducting microwave cavities), and drive the latter into highly
nonequilibrium states through electron tunneling events. I outline below the content of each Chapter:

* In Ch. -@sec:theory I introduce the theoretical and numerical framework
  upon which the main results are obtained, i.e., the Markovian quantum master
  equation to study the evolution of typical mesoscopic QED architectures.
* In Ch. -@sec:qdlaser I discuss a solid-state implementation of a
  single-atom maser, which is realized using a quantum dot in a
  spin-valve configuration between ferromagnetic contacts; I show how the
  systems exhibits unique features, such as the breakdown of the rotating-wave
  approximation, widely used in the light-matter interaction context, and a
  multistable lasing regime.
* In Chapter -@sec:cps I present a single-photon pump device based on a
  quantum-dot implementation of a Cooper-pair splitter, where an effective
  coupling between two distant
  harmonic resonators can be activated through Cooper-pair transport from a
  superconducting contact. This enables an efficient photon transfer mechanism, as well
  as cavity ground-state cooling.
* In Chapter -@sec:jjcavity I discuss the theory of double-Cooper-pair
  tunneling in a voltage-biased Josephson junction coupled to a microwave
  resonator. I analyze the transition regime between coherent and incoherent
  double-Cooper-pair tunneling, and further show how the system can be used as a
  single-photon source.
* In Chapter -@sec:conclusions I draw the conclusions and give an outlook on
  the work presented.
