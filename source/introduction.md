# Introduction


## Coupling light and matter: Cavity quantum electrodynamics
One of the most succesful and ever-developing applications of the quantum theory
is the investigation of the interaction between *light* and *matter*.
Historically, the first experiments involved real atoms
interacting with the quantized electromagnetic field of optical and microwave
cavities, within the framework commonly
referred to as cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED)
[@Raimond2001;@Walther2006;@Haroche2006].
