# Dynamical multistability in a quantum-dot laser {#sec:qdlaser}


*The results presented in this Chapter are published in Ref. \onlinecite{Mantovani2019}.*

## Introduction

One of the most remarkable paradigms of light-matter interaction is the laser [@Haken1984;@Siegman1986;@Scully1997], or maser, when the emitted radiation wavelength falls in the microwave regime.
The lasing mechanism is generally based on a population inversion established in a gaining medium, which interacts with the electromagnetic field inside a cavity.
The gaining medium can be scaled down to a single emitter, realizing a single-atom laser [@Mu1992].
Their full quantum theory has been proposed in the pioneering works of Scully and Lamb [@Scully1966;@Scully1967;@Sargent1993].
Later on, single-atom lasing action has been first observed experimentally in the regime of strong atom-field coupling with a single caesium atom in a high-finesse optical cavity [@McKeever2003].
Unlike conventional lasers, one-atom amplifiers exhibit unique features such as thresholdless behaviour (due to strong coupling), self-quenching, and a sub-Poissonian photon statistics reflecting the quantum nature of both field and atoms [@Carmichael2003].
Within the contest of cavity QED, a related setup is the micromaser [@Meschede1985;@Filipowicz1986;@Lugiato1987;@Walther2006], where a stream of excited atoms is injected into a cavity at a low rate, such that at most one atom at a time resides in the cavity.
The micromaser can display a succession of sharp transitions in the cavity photon number and multistability, whereby two or
more stable amplitudes of oscillation coexist.

The study of single-emitter lasers and micromasers has been later extended to hybrid condensed matter systems, where a number of theoretical models have been proposed and realized experimentally on a variety of platforms, such as superconducting qubits [@Astafiev2007;@Andre2009a;@Ashhab2009], quantum dots embedded in optical photonic crystals [@Nomura2010], devices based on Josephson junctions [@Rodrigues2007;@Rodrigues2007a;@Chen2014;@Cassidy2017], and especially single or double quantum dots [@Jin2011;@Jin2013;@Kulkarni2014;@Liu2014;@Lambert2015;@Gullans2015;@Liu2015;@Liu2017;@Liu2017a;@Agarwalla2019;@Rastelli2019;@Tabatabaei2020].
Recent experiments on self-sustained oscillations in carbon nanotubes with ultra-high quality factors [@Urgell2019;@Wen2019;@Willick2020] are a key step towards the implementation of single-atom *phonon* lasers utilizing mechanical resonators [@Vahala2009;@Mahboob2013].
Furthermore, the engineerization of effective interactions between *spins* and oscillation (mechanical or electromagnetic) has attracted a lot of theoretical and experimental attention over the past few years [@Palyi2012;@Stadler2014;@Stadler2015;@Viennot2015;@Parafilo2016;@Benito2017;@Mi2017;@Mi2018;@Landig2018;@Landig2019;@Cubaynes2019]
(see Ch. -@sec:introduction).

In this Chapter, I present an implementation of a single-atom laser based on the interaction between the electron spin in a quantum dot and a resonant cavity [@Mantovani2019].
The quantum dot is in a spin-valve configuration: It is tunnel coupled to ferromagnetic conductors having noncollinear magnetizations [@Braun2004;@Sahoo2005;@Bordoloi2019].
As a result, the electron transport is highly spin-dependent and influenced by the spin-flip processes due to the coupling with the resonator.
Within this approach, a phonon laser based on the spin-valve mechanism has been proposed [@Khaetskii2013].
Here, I show that our setup represents not only a simple mapping of a widely-studied theoretical model---the one-atom laser---on a solid-state platform.
By contrast, it allows access to a novel and rich regime of multistable laser dynamics.
This phenomenon arises from the breakdown of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), which is believed to hold when the effective coupling between light and matter $g$ remains small, when compared to the typical energy separation in the uncoupled subsystems (namely, the energy splitting $\Delta\epsilon$ of the two-level system and the cavity frequency $\omega_0$). 

After introducing the system and the model, I provide a semiclassical analysis to explain the multistable behavior, which agrees beautifully with the numerical simulations performed within a full quantum treatment of the resonator.
While the multistable regime of a mechanical oscillator or of a microwave resonator may be in principle detected through optical detection or quantum state tomography of a cavity, we show instead that it maps directly on the electron transport through the quantum dot:
The current displays a telegraph-like noise, associated with current jumps between different state of stability of the resonator. 

## Quantum-dot laser in the spin-valve setup


![Spin-valve-based quantum dot laser. (a) A microwave photon cavity or (b) a nanomechanical resonator mode are coupled to the spin of an electron in a quantum dot, in contact with ferromagnetic leads carrying spin-polarized current. (c) The system can be mapped onto a three-level single-atom laser, where electrons are pumped into the up-spin level, interact coherently emitting photons into the cavity, and decay into the empty-dot state by tunneling into the right lead.](figures/qdlaser-system.pdf){#fig:qdlaser:system}

The system I am considering is depicted in @fig:qdlaser:system. It consists of a quantum dot in the single-electron regime, with two nondegenerate spin levels ($|\uparrow\rangle$, $|\downarrow \rangle$), of energy difference $\Delta\epsilon$. 
The dot is embedded between two ferromagnetic contacts, which carry a spin-polarized current of opposite polarization.
The magnetization axis of the leads is chosen parallel to the quantization axis of the electronic spin in the dot.
The spin interacts with a single mode of a local resonator of frequency $\omega_0$, which can be either a microwave cavity or a nanomechanical resonator and is naturally damped through a thermal bath.
The Hamiltonian of the total system is given by

$$
    H_\text{tot} = H + H_\text{leads} + H_\text{tun} + H_\text{bath} + H_\text{osc-bath}.
$$
{#eq:qdlaser:total-hamiltonian}

Here, $H$ is the dot-resonator system Hamiltonian, $H_\text{leads}$ describes
the ferromagnetic contacts, $H_\text{tun}$ provides the electron tunneling
between dot and leads, $H_\text{bath}$ describes a generic
bosonic bath to which the resonator is damped through the coupling term $H_\text{osc-bath}$. The different contributions read:

\begin{align}
    H &= \epsilon_0 (n_\uparrow + n_\downarrow) + \frac{\Delta\epsilon}{2}
    (n_\uparrow - n_\downarrow) + U n_\uparrow n_\downarrow + \omega_0 b^\dagger b +
    g (b + b^\dagger) (d^\dagger_\uparrow d_\downarrow + \text{H.c.}),
    \label{eq:qdlaser:system-hamiltonian} \\
    H_\text{leads} &= \sum_{\nu=L,R} \sum_{k\sigma} (\varepsilon_{\nu k \sigma} -
    \mu_\nu) c^\dagger_{\nu k \sigma} c_{\nu k \sigma},
    \label{eq:qdlaser:leads-hamiltonian} \\
    H_\text{tun} &= \sum_{\nu=L,R} \sum_{k\sigma} V_{\nu \sigma} (c_{\nu k \sigma}
    d^\dagger_{\sigma} + \text{H.c.}),
    \label{eq:qdlaser:tunneling-hamiltonian} \\
    H_\text{osc-bath} &= b B + \text{H.c.}
    \label{eq:qdlaser:osc-bath-hamiltonian}
\end{align}

Let us first describe in detail the system Hamiltonian $H$: 
I have labeled with $\epsilon_0$ the average energy of the spin levels in the
dot, with $\Delta \epsilon$ their energy separation, and with $U>0$ the Coulomb
repulsion strength for the doubly-occupied state. 
The cavity mode (of frequency $\omega_0$) is coupled with strength $g$ to the quantum dot through the spin-oscillator interaction term. $d_\sigma$ is the fermionic operator annihilating an electron of spin $\sigma$ on the dot ($\sigma=\{ \uparrow, \downarrow \} = \{+, - \}$); 
$n_\sigma$ is the corresponding number operator. 
The cavity mode is described by the bosonic annihilation operator $b$.

The ferromagnetic leads are described in $H_\text{leads}$ by Fermi gas Hamiltonians, with $c_{\nu k \sigma}$ the annihilation operator for an excitation of momentum $k$ and energy $\epsilon_{\nu k \sigma}$ on the lead $\nu$ kept at chemical potential $\mu_\nu$. 
$V_{\nu \sigma}$ is the electron tunneling amplitude. 
Finally, $B$ describes a generic operator of the bosonic bath coupled linearly to the resonator.
The three reservoirs are assumed to be at separate thermal equilibria at
temperature $T$ (but can be at different chemical potentials).

## Quantum master equation

In this Section, I derive the Markovian master equation describing the dynamics of the system density matrix $\rho$, under the coherent evolution given by Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:system-hamiltonian) and the dissipative mechanisms due to the electron tunneling and the resonator damping. 
The external environment is governed by the Hamiltonian $H_E = H_\text{leads} + H_\text{bath}$, and it interacts with the system through $H_\text{int} = H_\text{tun} + H_\text{osc-bath}$. 
Assuming that the weak-coupling and large reservoir limits, the Born-Markov approximation holds (see Ch. -@sec:theory). The Wangsness-Bloch-Redfield master equation for the system (in the Schr√∂dinger picture) reads [@Redfield1957;@Timm2008]:

$$
    \dot{\rho}(t) = -i [ H, \rho(t)] - \int_0^\infty d\tau \text{Tr}_E \{
    [H_\text{int}, [H_\text{int}(-\tau), \rho (t) \rho_\text{leads}(0)
    \rho_\text{bath}(0) ] ] \} \equiv \mathcal{L} \rho(t).
$$
{#eq:qdlaser:bloch-redfield-equation}

Here, $\rho_\text{leads}(0)$ and $\rho_\text{bath}(0)$ represent the states of the reservoirs at the initial time ($t=0$); 
$\mathcal{L}$ is the total Liouvillian
superoperator. 
Its action on $\rho$ can be decomposed into the sum of a coherent part ($\mathcal{L}_H \rho = -i [H, \rho]$) and a dissipative part $\mathcal{L}_\text{leads}\rho + \mathcal{L}_\text{bath}\rho$.

In order to simplify Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:bloch-redfield-equation), I make three important assumptions:

(i) A large bias voltage $V$ is applied symmetrically to the leads, such that $\mu_L = eV/2$, $\mu_R = -eV/2$, with $V \gg \{k_B T; \omega_0; \Delta\epsilon\}$. 
  The Fermi functions $f_\nu (x) = \{\exp [(x - \mu_\nu)/k_BT] + 1\}^{-1}$ are then $f_L \approx 1$ and $f_R \approx 0$, with no energy dependence. 
  This means that electron transport is allowed from the left to the right lead, while it is completely suppressed in the opposite direction.

(ii) The Coulomb repulsion strength $U$ is the largest energy scale in the system, such that the doubly-occupied state in the quantum dot becomes energetically inaccessible, and it cannot be thermally populated. 
  Thus, it can be projected out from the electronic Hilbert space. Formally, we have $U \gg eV \gg \{k_B T; \omega_0; \Delta\epsilon\}$. 
  Consequently, the coherent dynamics given by Hamiltonian (-@eq:qdlaser:system-hamiltonian) only involves the two spin states ($|\uparrow \rangle, |\downarrow \rangle$). 
  This allows us to map Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:system-hamiltonian) into the Rabi Hamiltonian [@Rabi1936;@Rabi1937]:
  $$
  H = \frac{\Delta\epsilon}{2}\sigma_z + \omega_0 b^\dagger b + g (\sigma_+ +
      \sigma_-)(b + b^\dagger).
  $$
  {#eq:qdlaser:rabi-hamiltonian} 
  The Coulomb term in Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:system-hamiltonian) has been removed, and we have mapped the dot operators to the Pauli algebra through $n_\uparrow-n_\downarrow \rightarrow \sigma_z$ and $d_\uparrow^\dagger d_\downarrow \rightarrow \sigma_+$, after projecting out the empty and the doubly-occupied states from the dot Hilbert space. 
  Notice that, however, the empty state $|0\rangle$ must be taken into account in the open dynamics: 
  In the single-electron regime, transport through the dot necessarily involves the third state $|0\rangle$.
  
(iii) The spin-resonator coupling strength $g$ is small compared to the typical bare energy scale of the two subsystems, i.e., 
  $g \ll \{\Delta\epsilon; \omega_0\}$.
  This allows us to safely treat Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:bloch-redfield-equation) in the local basis $|n, \sigma\rangle$ of the uncoupled system ($n$ is the Fock number of the resonator), deriving a *local* master equation [@Cattaneo2019]. 

Under assumptions (i)-(iii), the time integrals in Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:bloch-redfield-equation) can be performed and they lead to a quantum master equation in Lindblad form:

$$
    \dot{\rho} = -i[H, \rho] + \sum_{\sigma} [\Gamma_L^\sigma
    \mathcal{D}(F^\dagger_\sigma)\rho + \Gamma^\sigma_R \mathcal{D} (F_\sigma)\rho] + \kappa (1 + n_B)\mathcal{D}(b) +
    \kappa n_B \mathcal{D}(b^\dagger).
$$
{#eq:qdlaser:lindblad-equation}

Within the wide-band approximation, whereby the spectral densities of the
fermionic reservoirs are energy-independent, the electronic tunneling rates are given by
$\Gamma_\nu^\sigma = 2 \pi |V_{\nu \sigma}|^2 \rho_{\nu \sigma}$, where
$\rho_{\nu\sigma}$ is the spin-$\sigma$ density of states at the Fermi level of lead $\nu$. 
Since the leads are ferromagnetic, the spin dependence of the
tunneling rates can be written in terms of the polarizations $P_\nu$ of the
leads as $\Gamma_\nu^\sigma = \Gamma_\nu ( 1 + \sigma P_\nu)/2$, 
with $0 \leq P_\nu\leq 1$. 
Although for standard ferromagnetic contacts (Co and PdNi alloys) $P_\nu$ does not exceed 0.5 [@Sahoo2005;@Viennot2015;@Cubaynes2019], it can be equal to unity for half-metallic leads [@Ziese2002]. In the following, without losing generality in the results, I will assume a symmetric and opposite polarization of the leads, i.e., $P_L = -P_R = P$, allowing us to write the tunneling rates as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Gamma_{L}^{\uparrow}&=\Gamma_{L}\left(\frac{1+P}{2}\right), \quad \Gamma_{L}^{\downarrow}=\Gamma_{L}\left(\frac{1-P}{2}\right), \\ \Gamma_{R}^{\uparrow}&=\Gamma_{R}\left(\frac{1-P}{2}\right), \quad \Gamma_{R}^{\downarrow}=\Gamma_{R}\left(\frac{1+P}{2}\right).
\end{aligned}
$$
{#eq:qdlaser:tunneling-rates}

In the electronic dissipators, we have replaced the fermionic operator $d_\sigma$ with $F_\sigma = (1 - n_{-\sigma})d_\sigma$, such that the population and the coherences involving the doubly-occupied state are forced to vanish, as required by the large Coulomb repulsion limit.

For the cavity, $\kappa = \omega_0 / Q$ is the decay rate ($Q$ is
the quality factor), and $n_B = [\exp(\omega_0 / k_B T) - 1]^{-1}$ is the average number of excitations in the thermal bath at the resonator frequency. 

The steady state $\rho_\text{st}$ of Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:lindblad-equation), obtained by solving $\dot{\rho} = 0$, is the central object that I will employ to calculate the relevant stationary expectation values for the system, together with the cavity Fock distribution. 
The numerical steady solution of Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:lindblad-equation) has been found using [qutip]{.smallcaps} [@Johansson2012].

## Single-atom laser within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA)

### RWA Hamiltonian and Jaynes-Cummings model

![Energy ladder of the uncoupled dot-resonator system (black lines). When $\Delta\epsilon \approx \omega_0$, the RWA Hamiltonian (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-hamiltonian) describes the hybridization of the pairs $\{|\uparrow, n\rangle, |\downarrow,n+1\rangle\}$, giving rise to the Jaynes-Cummings doublet \[green lines, Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-doublet)\]. The energy separation of each doublet grows proportionally to $g\sqrt{n+1}$. ](figures/qdlaser-rwa-diagram.pdf){#fig:qdlaser:rwa-diagram}

The theoretical treatment of the single-atom laser usually relies upon the so-called rotating-wave approximation (RWA). It consists in replacing the Rabi model Hamiltonian with the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) one [@Jaynes1963]:

$$
	H_\text{RWA} = \frac{\Delta \epsilon}{2} \sigma_z + \omega_0 b^\dagger b + g (\sigma_+ b + \sigma_- b^\dagger).
$$
{#eq:qdlaser:rwa-hamiltonian}

Equation (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-hamiltonian) can be derived from the Rabi Hamiltonian (-@eq:qdlaser:rabi-hamiltonian) by moving to interaction picture and assuming a small detuning $\delta \ll \omega_0 + \Delta\epsilon$, with $\delta = |\omega_0 - \Delta\epsilon|$. Further, one must also ensure that $g\sqrt{n} \ll \{\omega_0; \Delta \epsilon\}$, where $n$ is the cavity Fock number. In @fig:qdlaser:rwa-diagram, I sketch the effective interaction described by the JC model, close to resonance, i.e., $\delta \approx 0$. The interaction (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-hamiltonian) mixes *only* the states $|\uparrow, n\rangle$ and $|\downarrow,n+1\rangle$. Diagonalizing the interaction in the subspace spanned by these two states yields the JC doublet

$$
\begin{aligned}
    |n+\rangle &= \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) |\uparrow, n\rangle + \sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2}\right) |\downarrow,n+1\rangle, \\
    |n-\rangle &= -\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) |\uparrow, n\rangle + \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)  |\downarrow,n+1\rangle, 
\end{aligned}
$$
{#eq:qdlaser:rwa-doublet}

with eigenenergies $E_{n\pm} = \omega_0 \left(n + \frac{1}{2} \right) \pm \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{4g^2(n+1) + \delta^2}$ and mixing angle $\theta = \arctan \left( \frac{2 g \sqrt{n+1}}{\delta}\right)$. Notice that the doublet splitting is proportional to $g\sqrt{n+1}$, i.e., the eigenvalue ladder of the JC Hamiltonian is anharmonic. If $g\sqrt{n+1}$ becomes comparable with the bare level separation of the uncoupled system, Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-hamiltonian) is no longer valid, as doublets with different quantum number $n$ become closer in energy, and their interaction (which is not captured by the RWA Hamiltonian) cannot be neglected anymore. For atom-field cavity systems, $g/\omega_0 \sim 10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ [@Raimond2001], hence Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-hamiltonian) remains valid also for photon numbers $n \gg 1$ characteristic of laser emission. However, as the technological development in solid-state devices pushes the ratio $g/\omega_0$ order of magnitudes higher, a more careful consideration on the validity of the RWA is necessary when designing systems with large photon number.


### Density matrix theory {#sec:qdlaser:rwa-density-matrix}

Using Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-hamiltonian) in Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:lindblad-equation), it is possible to obtain the approximate analytical expression for the steady-state Fock distribution of the cavity, $p_n$ (details of the calculations are provided in Appendix ...). 
In particular, when close to the resonant condition $\Delta\epsilon = \omega_0$, the $p_n$ is obtained through the following recursive equation:

$$
	\left[\frac{n \kappa \left( \frac{g}{g_\text{thr}}\right)^2}{1 + \frac{n}{A_s^2}\left(\frac{g}{g_\text{thr}}\right)^2} + \kappa n_B \right] p_{n-1} = \kappa( 1+ n_B)p_n,
$$
{#eq:qdlaser:rwa-pn}

with the quantities

$$
A_s^2 = \frac{\Gamma_L \Gamma_R P}{(2\Gamma_L + \Gamma_R)\kappa}, \qquad g_\text{thr} = \sqrt{\frac{\Gamma_R \kappa}{4} \left[ \frac{2 \Gamma_L (1 + P^2)+ \Gamma_R(1 - P^2)}{4 \Gamma_L P}\right]}.
$$
{#eq:qdlaser:rwa-pn-saturation-thr}

I will refer to $A_s^2$ as the *saturation number* and to $g_\text{thr}$ as the *lasing threshold* coupling. 
The solution of Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-pn) reads

$$
	p_n = p_0 \frac{\mathcal{N}_n}{\mathcal{D}_n} \left ( \frac{n_B}{n_B+1}\right)^n.
$$
{#eq:qdlaser:rwa-pn-solution}

Here, I have introduced the Pochhammer symbol (or rising factorial) $a_n = a (a+1) (a+2)\cdots (a + n - 1)$ and defined the quantities

$$
	\mathcal{N} = 1 + \frac{A_s^2}{n_B} + A_s^2 \frac{g_\text{thr}}{g}, \qquad \mathcal{D} = 1 + A_s^2 \frac{g_\text{thr}}{g}.
$$

The prefactor $p_0$ is the zero-Fock occupation number and is determined from the normalization condition $\sum_{n=0}^\infty p_n = 1$, leaving us with

$$
	p_0 = \frac{1}{_2 F_1 \left(1, \mathcal{N}; \mathcal{D}; \frac{n_B}{n_B+1}\right)},
$$

with the hypergeometric function $_2 F_1 (a, b; c; z)$. At zero temperature, one finds instead $p_0 = \left[_1 F_1 (1; A_s^2 g_\text{thr}^2 / g^2; n_B/(n_B+1)\right]^{-1}$, with the confluent hypergeometric function $_1 F_1(a; b; z)$. 
A more interesting quantity is represented by the average photon number, $\bar{n} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty n p_n$, which is found to be

$$
	\bar{n} = A_s^2 \left[1 -  \left(\frac{g_\text{thr}}{g} \right)^2\right] + n_B + n_B(n_B + 1) \left(\frac{g_\text{thr}}{g} \right)^2 p_0.
$$

### Semiclassical theory {#sec:qdlaser:rwa-semiclassical}

Equation (-@eq:qdlaser:lindblad-equation) allows us to derive the equation of motion for the expectation value of a system operator $O$, defined as $\langle O \rangle = \text{Tr} (O \rho)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
        \langle \dot{O} \rangle = &-i \langle [O, H] \rangle + \sum_\sigma \left[
         \Gamma_L^\sigma \left(\langle F_\sigma O F^\dagger_\sigma \rangle - \frac{1}{2}
        \langle \{ O, F_\sigma F_\sigma^\dagger \} \rangle \right) + \Gamma_R^\sigma \left( \langle F^\dagger_\sigma O F_\sigma \rangle - \frac{1}{2}
        \langle \{ O, F^\dagger_\sigma F_\sigma \} \rangle\right) \right] + \\
        &+ \kappa (1 + n_B) \left(\langle b^\dagger O b \rangle - \frac{1}{2}
        \langle \{ O, b^\dagger b \} \rangle \right) + \kappa n_B \left( \langle
        b O b^\dagger \rangle - \frac{1}{2}
        \langle \{ O, b b^\dagger \} \rangle\right). 
\end{aligned}
$$
{#eq:qdlaser:eq-motion}


Using the RWA Hamiltonian in Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:eq-motion), one is able to derive a nonlinear set of dynamical equations which govern the system. 
For simplicity, let us set $P=1$ and $n_B = 0$. The equations read:

\begin{align}
	\langle \dot{n}_\uparrow \rangle &= - \Gamma_L \langle n_\uparrow - n_\downarrow \rangle - ig\langle b \sigma_+ - b^\dagger \sigma_- \rangle + \Gamma_L, \label{eq:qdlaser:rwa-semiclassical-system-1} \\
	\langle \dot{n}_\downarrow \rangle &= \Gamma_R \langle n_\downarrow \rangle + ig \langle b \sigma_+ - b^\dagger \sigma_-\rangle, \\
	\langle \dot{\sigma}_- \rangle &= \left(- i \Delta \epsilon - \frac{\Gamma_R}{2} \right) \langle \sigma_- \rangle + ig \langle (b + b^\dagger) (n_\uparrow - n_\downarrow) \rangle, \quad \text{and c.c.}, \\
	\langle \dot{b} \rangle &= \left( -i \omega_0 - \frac{\kappa}{2}\right) \langle b \rangle - ig\langle \sigma_- \rangle, \quad \text{and c.c.} \label{eq:qdlaser:rwa-semiclassical-system-4}
\end{align}

Equations (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-semiclassical-system-1)-(-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-semiclassical-system-4) contain expectation values involving both spin and cavity operators: Writing equations of motions for these terms will involve higher order operators and lead to an infinite hierarchy of equations, which cannot be solved. 
To close the set of equations, the semiclassical approximation is needed. It consists in replacing the bosonic operator $b$ by the complex number $\alpha = Ae^{i\phi}$. $A$ and $\phi$ correspond to the semiclassical amplitude and phase of the resonator, respectively. 
The semiclassical approximation basically amounts to neglecting the quantum fluctuations in the resonator. 
Let us now switch to a rotating frame with the replacements $\langle \sigma_- \rangle \rightarrow \langle \sigma_- \rangle e^{-i \Delta\epsilon t}$ and $\alpha \rightarrow \alpha e^{-i\omega_0 t}$. Further, I set the spin quantities $S_x = \langle \sigma_+ + \sigma_-\rangle$, $S_y = -i\langle \sigma_+ - \sigma_- \rangle$, $S_z = \langle n_\uparrow - n_\downarrow \rangle$, and the total dot occupation $p_1 = \langle n_\uparrow + n_\downarrow \rangle$. Finally, we consider the special case where $\Gamma_L = \Gamma_R/2 = \Gamma$ in Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:tunneling-rates): With this condition, the equation for $p_1$ decouples from the rest of the system and can thus be disregarded. However, it is worth remarking that this condition does not alter the physical results, but merely yields a simplification in the analytical calculations. At resonance $(\Delta \epsilon = \omega_0$) one obtains the set of equations

\begin{align}
\dot{S}_{x} &=-\Gamma S_{x}-2 g A \sin \phi S_{z}, \label{eq:qdlaser:rwa-semiclassical-system-alt-1} \\
\dot{S}_{y} &=-\Gamma S_{y}-2 g A \cos \phi S_{z}, \\ 
\dot{S}_{z} &= \Gamma-\Gamma S_{z}+2 g A\left(\sin \phi S_{x}+\cos \phi S_{y}\right), \\ 
\dot{A} &=-\frac{\kappa}{2} A+\frac{g}{2}\left(-\sin \phi S_{x}+\cos \phi S_{y}\right), \\ 
\dot{\phi}&=-\frac{g}{2 A}\left(\cos \phi S_{x}-\sin \phi S_{y}\right). \label{eq:qdlaser:rwa-semiclassical-system-alt-5}
\end{align}

The equations for $A$ and $\phi$ have been obtained by transforming the corresponding equations for $\alpha$ and $\alpha^*$, using $\alpha = A e^{i\phi}$. The system (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-semiclassical-system-alt-1)-(-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-semiclassical-system-alt-1) is a nonlinear system describing lasing oscillations in the resonator, under the influence of the spin dynamics  (driven by the single-electron tunneling at rate $\Gamma$). It easy to study the stability of the resonator by setting the time derivatives to zero and looking for the stationary solution. The solution is independent on $\phi$, which can be set to zero. For finite polarization $P<1$, the dynamical equation for the resonator amplitude is

$$
\dot{A}=-\frac{A}{2}\left[\kappa-\frac{\frac{2 g^{2} P}{\Gamma}}{1+\left(\frac{2 g A}{\Gamma}\right)^{2}}\right]=-\frac{A}{2}\left[\kappa+\gamma_{\mathrm{RWA}}(A)\right].
$$
{#eq:qdlaser:rwa-resonator-amplitude}
In the latter equality, we have defined an effective, negative nonlinear damping $\gamma_\mathrm{RWA}(A)$: It encompasses the driving effect of the electron dynamics, opposing the natural damping of the resonator at decay rate $\kappa$. By setting $\dot{A} = 0$, we obtain a nonlinear algebraic equations with two steady solutions for the occupation number $\bar{n} = A^2$, i.e.:

$$
\bar{n} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad
\bar{n}=A_{s}^{2}\left[1-\left(\frac{g_{\mathrm{thr}}}{g}\right)^{2}\right].
$$

The saturation number and threshold coupling read

$$
A_s^2 = \frac{\Gamma P}{2 \kappa}, \quad g_\text{thr} = \sqrt{\frac{\Gamma \kappa}{2 P}},
$$

respectively. Notice that they are in full agreement with Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-pn-saturation-thr), obtained with the full quantum approach. The stability analysis of Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-resonator-amplitude) reveals a bifurcation point at $g= g_\mathrm{thr}$: for $g \leq g_\mathrm{thr}$, the only (stable) solution is $\bar{n} = 0$, corresponding to absence of lasing. For $g > g_\mathrm{thr}$, $\bar{n} = 0$ is an unstable solution, while the other solution with large $\bar{n}$ is the stable one. For a large coupling, $g \gg g_\mathrm{thr}$, the nonlinear damping $\gamma_\mathrm{RWA}$ essentially loses its dependence on $g$. This causes the average occupation number to saturate to the value $A_s^2$. Notice that the $A$-dependence of $\gamma_\mathrm{RWA}$ is crucial to obtain a finite steady value for $\bar{n}$. For completeness, I report here the more general expression of $\gamma_\mathrm{RWA}$ for arbitrary tunneling rates and $P=1$ (obtained by including the equation for $p_1$ in the stationary solution of the system), which is given by

$$
\gamma_{\mathrm{RWA}}(A)=-\frac{g^{2} \Gamma_{\mathrm{eff}}}{g^{2} A^{2}+\Gamma_{\mathrm{eff}} \Gamma_{R} / 4},
$$

where $\Gamma_{\mathrm{eff}}=\Gamma_{L} \Gamma_{R}/(2 \Gamma_{L}+\Gamma_{R})$. Accordingly, the expressions for saturation number and threshold coupling become

$$
g_{\mathrm{thr}}^{2}=\frac{\Gamma_{R}\kappa}{4}, \quad A_{s}=\sqrt{\frac{\Gamma_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\kappa} }
$$

The lasing threshold for fully polarized leads only depends on the right-tunneling rate $\Gamma_R$, as a consequence of the large Coulomb repulsion in the dot: Since only one electron can reside in the system at a given instant, a photon-emission event can only take place if the electron has tunneled out into the right contact. A large value of $\Gamma_R$ pushes the threshold for lasing to appear to higher values of $g$ [**explain better**].

In @fig:qdlaser:rwa-laser I summarize the analytical results obtained with the semiclassical approximation and with the density matrix approach of @sec:qdlaser:rwa-density-matrix. **Discussion on results**; **High efficiency of pumping**; **Necessity to release RWA**.

## Beyond the rotating-wave approximation: Multistability

In the previous Section, I have analyzed the lasing behavior of the quantum-dot laser assuming the validity of the RWA Hamiltonian (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-hamiltonian). However, the _a posteriori_ analysis of the results reveals a peculiarity of our system with respect to similar (atomic and solid-state) implementations of the single-atom laser: The spin-dependent transport yields a very large photon emission efficiency (for the case of full polarization and negligible spin relaxation processes, each electron passing through the dot emits one photon), such that the quantity $g\sqrt{\bar{n}}$ becomes comparable to the bare resonator frequency $\omega_0$, even for relatively low values of the ratio $g/\omega_0$. Consequently, without the technologically challenging need to enter the *ultrastrong-coupling* regime (characterized by $g/\omega_0 \sim 1$, see Ch. -@sec:introduction), the system is expected to show a clear and unique deviation from the RWA physics. 

**Write here a sentence to explain what we are going to do.**

### Semiclassical equations beyond RWA

The semiclassical approach utilized in @sec:qdlaser:rwa-semiclassical can be extended beyond the RWA by using the full Rabi Hamiltonian (-@eq:qdlaser:rabi-hamiltonian). First, Eqs. (-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-semiclassical-system-1)-(-@eq:qdlaser:rwa-semiclassical-system-4) are replaced by

\begin{align}
\left\langle\dot{ n}_{\uparrow}\right\rangle &=-\Gamma_{L}
\langle n_{\uparrow}\rangle-\Gamma_{L}\langle n_{\downarrow}\rangle-i g\langle( b+ b^{\dagger})(\sigma_{+}-\sigma_{-})\rangle+\Gamma_{L}, \\ \langle\dot{ n}_{\downarrow}\rangle &=-\Gamma_{R}\langle n_{\downarrow}\rangle+i g\langle( b+ b^{\dagger})(\sigma_{+}-\sigma_{-})\rangle, \\ \langle\dot{\sigma}_{-}\rangle &=\left(-i \Delta \epsilon-\frac{\Gamma_{R}}{2}\right)\langle\sigma_{-}\rangle+i g\langle( b+ b^{\dagger}) \sigma_{z}\rangle, \quad \text{and c.c.}, \\ \langle\dot{ b}\rangle &= \left(-i \omega_{0}-\frac{\kappa}{2}\right)\langle b\rangle-i g\langle \sigma_{+}+\sigma_{-}\rangle, \quad \text{and c.c.}
\end{align}

After the semiclassical approximation, setting again $\Gamma_L = \Gamma_R/2  = \Gamma$, $P=1$ and $\Delta\epsilon = \omega_0$, and moving to the rotating frame as above, the system can be written as

\begin{align} 
\dot{S}_{x} &=- \Gamma S_{x}-2 g A[\sin (2 \omega_{0} t-\phi)+\sin \phi] S_{z}, \label{eq:qdlaser:no-rwa-semiclassical-system-1} \\ 
\dot{S}_{y} &=-\Gamma S_{y}-2 g A[\cos (2 \omega_{0} t-\phi)+\cos \phi] S_{z},\label{eq:qdlaser:no-rwa-semiclassical-system-2} \\ 
\dot{S}_{z} &=-\Gamma S_{z}+2 g A \{[\sin (2 \omega_{0} t-\phi)+\sin \phi] S_{x} +[\cos (2 \omega_{0} t-\phi)+\cos \phi] S_{y}\}+\Gamma, \label{eq:qdlaser:no-rwa-semiclassical-system-3} \\ 
\dot{A} &= -\frac{\kappa}{2} A+\frac{g}{2}\left\{\left[\sin \left(2 \omega_{0} t-\phi\right)-\sin \phi\right] S_{x} + \left[\cos \left(2 \omega_{0} t-\phi\right)+\cos \phi\right] S_{y}\right\}, \label{eq:qdlaser:no-rwa-semiclassical-system-4} \\ 
\dot{\phi} &= -\frac{g}{2 A}\left\{\left[\cos \left(2 \omega_{0} t-\phi\right)+\cos \phi\right] S_{x} -\left[\sin \left(2 \omega_{0} t-\phi\right)+\sin \phi\right] S_{y}\right\}. \label{eq:qdlaser:no-rwa-semiclassical-system-5}
\end{align}

Contrary to the RWA case, this nonlinear set of equations does not have a stationary solution in the rotating frame: The resonator will approach a limit-cycle oscillating solution. A more thorough analysis is then necessary to gain further quantitative information on the long-time limit behavior of the resonator dynamics.
The basic idea consists in studying Eqs. (-@eq:qdlaser:no-rwa-semiclassical-system-1)-(-@eq:qdlaser:no-rwa-semiclassical-system-5) in Fourier space, deriving an effective expression for the nonlinear damping of the resonator, $\gamma_\mathrm{eff}$. To achieve this, it is crucial to exploit the fact that the dynamics of the resonator amplitude $A$ is *slow* compared to the electronic driving and to the oscillations themselves, a condition satisfied when $\kappa \ll \{\Gamma; g; \omega_0\}$. I also assume that, eventually, the phase of the oscillator evolves harmonically as $\phi = \omega_0 t$. This can be checked empirically by solving numerically the time-dependent equations (-@eq:qdlaser:no-rwa-semiclassical-system-1)-(-@eq:qdlaser:no-rwa-semiclassical-system-5) and looking at the long-time behavior of $A(t)$. It is then possible to average the charge dynamics \[determined by Eqs. (-@eq:qdlaser:no-rwa-semiclassical-system-1)-(-@eq:qdlaser:no-rwa-semiclassical-system-3)\] over a resonator period $\mathcal{T} = 2\pi/\omega_0$, during which $A$ can be considered constant. In this way, one can calculate the coarse-grained effect of the charge dynamics on the resonator amplitude. Averaging Eq. (-@eq:qdlaser:no-rwa-semiclassical-system-4) over $\mathcal{T}$, we obtain

$$
\dot{\overline{A}} = -\frac{\kappa}{2}\overline{A} + \frac{g}{\mathcal{T}} \int_0^\mathcal{T} dt\prime \cos (\omega_0 t') S_y(t'),
$$
