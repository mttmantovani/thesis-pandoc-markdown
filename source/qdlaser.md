## Introduction

One of the most remarkable paradigms of light-matter interaction is the laser [@Haken1984;@Siegman1986;@Scully1997], or maser, when the emitted radiation wavelength falls in the microwave regime. The lasing mechanism is generally based on a population inversion established in a gaining medium, which interacts with the electromagnetic field inside a cavity. The gaining medium can be scaled down to a single emitter, realizing a single-atom laser [@Mu1992]. Their full quantum theory has been proposed in the pioneering works of Scully and Lamb [@Scully1966;@Scully1967;@Sargent1993]. Later on, single-atom lasing action has been first observed experimentally in the regime of strong atom-field coupling with a single caesium atom in a high-finesse optical cavity [@McKeever2003]. Unlike conventional lasers, one-atom amplifiers exhibit unique features such as thresholdless behaviour (due to strong coupling), self-quenching, and a sub-Poissonian photon statistics reflecting the quantum nature of both field and atoms [@Carmichael2003]. Within the contest of cavity QED, a related setup is the micromaser [@Meschede1985;@Filipowicz1986;@Lugiato1987;@Walther2006], where a stream of excited atoms is injected into a cavity at a low rate, such that at most one atom at a time resides in the cavity. The micromaser can display a succession of sharp transitions in the cavity photon number and multistability, whereby two or
more stable amplitudes of oscillation coexist.

The study of single-emitter lasers and micromasers has been later extended to hybrid condensed matter systems, where a number of theoretical models have been proposed and realized experimentally on a variety of platforms, such as superconducting qubits [@Astafiev2007;@Andre2009a;@Ashhab2009], quantum dots embedded in optical photonic crystals [@Nomura2010], devices based on Josephson junctions [@Rodrigues2007;@Rodrigues2007a;@Chen2014;@Cassidy2017], and double quantum dots **ADD THEORY PAPERS!** [@Lambert2015;@Liu2015;@Liu2017;@Liu2017a]. Recent experiments on self-sustained oscillations in carbon nanotubes with ultra-high quality factors are a key step towards the implementation of vibrational single-atom lasers with mechanical resonators [@Urgell2019;@Wen2019;@Willick2020]. Furthermore, the engineerization of effective interactions between *spins* and oscillation (mechanical or electromagnetic) has attracted a lot of theoretical and experimental attention over the past few years [@Palyi2012;@Stadler2014;@Stadler2015;@Viennot2015;@Parafilo2016;@Benito2017;@Mi2017;@Mi2018;@Landig2018;@Landig2019;@Cubaynes2019]
(see Ch. -@sec:introduction).

In this Chapter, I present an implementation of a single-atom laser based on the interaction between the electron spin in a quantum dot and a resonant cavity [@Mantovani2019]. The quantum dot is in a spin-valve configuration: It is tunnel coupled to ferromagnetic conductors having noncollinear magnetizations [@Braun2004;@Sahoo2005;@Bordoloi2019]. As a result, the electron transport is highly spin-dependent and influenced by the spin-flip processes due to the coupling with the resonator. Within this approach, a phonon laser based on the spin-valve mechanism has been proposed [@Khaetskii2013]. Here, I show that our setup represents not only a simple mapping of a widely-studied theoretical model---the one-atom laser---on a solid-state platform. By contrast, it allows access to a novel and rich regime of multistable laser dynamics. This phenomenon arises from the breakdown of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), which is believed to hold when the effective coupling between light and matter $g$ remains small, when compared to the typical energy separation in the uncoupled subsystems (namely, the energy splitting $\Delta\epsilon$ of the two-level system and the cavity frequency $\omega_0$). 

After introducing the system and the model, I provide a semiclassical analysis to explain the multistable behavior, which agrees beautifully with the numerical simulations performed within a full quantum treatment of the resonator. While the multistable regime of a mechanical oscillator or of a microwave resonator may be in principle detected through optical detection or quantum state tomography of a cavity, we show instead that it maps directly on the electron transport through the quantum dot: The current displays a telegraph-like noise, associated with current jumps between different state of stability of the resonator.
