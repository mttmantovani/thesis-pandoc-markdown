## Introduction

One of the most remarkable paradigms of light-matter interaction is the laser
\cite{Haken1984,Siegman1986,Scully1997}, or maser, when the emitted radiation
wavelength falls in the microwave regime. The lasing mechanism is generally
based on a population inversion established in a gaining medium, which interacts
with the electromagnetic field inside a cavity.
