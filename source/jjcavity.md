## Introduction

The purpose of this Chapter is to present an example of how
resonators coupled to mesoscopic conductors can influence dramatically the
charge transport, even changing the effective charge that tunnels through.
In standard mesoscopic conductors or in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), the
charge tunneling often comes together with photon emission, and this mechanism
can be enhanced through the coupling to a resonator
[@Berndt1991;@Berndt1993;@Holst1994;@Atay2004;@Schneider2010;@Hofheinz2011]. 
Conversely, it has been shown how a resonator can mediate correlated tunneling
of *two* electrons across a junction, in order to generate a cavity photon at a
energy higher than the single-electron one. This fenomenon is known as overbias
emission [@Schneider2010;@Peters2017;@Xu2014;@Kaasbjerg2015;@Xu2016]. 
Here, I consider a solid-state device consisting of a Josephson
junction (JJ) coupled to a LC-resonator, and theoretically analyze the correlated
tunneling of *two* Cooper pairs across the JJ [@Morley2019]. This higher-order tunneling
process is enhanced and becomes resonant when the bias voltage applied to the
junction is such that two Cooper pairs are required to tunnel to cooperatively
emit a photon at the cavity frequency. I will present an effective Hamiltonian
formulation of the problem and discuss how the double-Cooper-pair tunneling (DCPT) rate
can exceed the single-Cooper-pair one. Further, I will reveal how this
unconventional transport channel leads to an unusual form of photon blockade
[@Imamoglu1997;@Biella2015;@Vaneph2018;@Chang2014] that makes the system an
ideal single-photon source [@Grimm2019].
